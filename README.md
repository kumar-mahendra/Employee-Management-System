#### Conclusion 

The only purpose of this app was to help me understand flask web framework and sqlalchemy which is a ORM (object relational mapper ) . Using ORM ensure increased readability of code and reduce repitition. 


#### Future Scope 

- UI can be improved.
- Add a seperate page showing employee details with photograph and other details. 
- Add authentication before entering into database. Authentication could be username& password based or face recognition based.
